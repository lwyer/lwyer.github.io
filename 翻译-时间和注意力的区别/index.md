# The difference between time and attention（时间和注意力的区别）| 翻译


A few years ago I realized that if I’m too busy to take something on, I shouldn’t say “I don’t have the time”. In fact, I often do have the time. It’s not that hard to squeeze in some extra time for someone.

> 几年前我意识到，如果我太忙没法做某些事情，我不应该说“我没有时间”。事实上，我经常有这个时间，为某些人挤出一些额外的时间并不难。

What I don’t have – and what I can’t squeeze in – is more attention. Attention is a far more limited resource than time. So what I should say is “I don’t have the attention”. I may have 8 hours a day for work, but I probably have 4 hours a day for attention.

> 我所没有的——也是我不能挤出来的——是更多的注意力。注意力是一种远比时间更有限的资源。所以我应该说的是“我没有注意力”。我可能每天有8小时用来工作，但我可能有四小时能保持专注。 

One summer, a guy wrote me out of the blue asking if he could intern for me. His email was great – clear, thoughtful, kind, inviting, confident but not pushy, and not too long (but long enough to say what he had to say without leaving anything out). He was studying at Harvard Business School and was going to be back in Chicago that summer.

> 一个夏天，一个人突然给我写信，问我他是否可以来我这实习。他的电子邮件写的很好——清晰，周到，亲切，有吸引力的，自信但不咄咄逼人 ，而且不长（但足够说明他想要说的且没有遗漏任何东西）。他正在哈佛商学院学习，并且那个夏天会回到芝加哥。

He asked if he could swing by and say hi. His email made it easy for me to say yes. So he did, and we had a great session. We spent maybe an hour or so together. I learned about his background, what kind of stuff he was interested in, what he wanted to learn, what he could teach us, etc. Then we riffed on a few ideas. It was natural, flowing, effortless. Really promising.

> 他问我他是否可以顺便过来打个招呼。他的电子邮件让我很容易就答应了。于是他来了，并且我们进行了一次很好的会谈。我们在一起花了大概一小时左右的时间。我了解了他的背景，他对什么样的东西感兴趣，他想学什么，他能教我们什么，等等。  然后我们重复（讨论）一些想法。这个（过程）是自然的，流畅的，不费力的。很有希望。 

Then I told him I’d think a few things over and get back to him soon. He checked in a few weeks later, and I said I’d get back to him soon again. And I didn’t.

> 之后我告诉他我会考虑一些事情并尽快回复他。几周后他来检查（了解情况），然后我再次告诉他我会尽快回复，但我没有。

A month or so after that I wrote him and told him I was really sorry. I’d mislead him – and myself – thinking I had enough time to take on a intern that summer. I wanted to, I really liked him, I thought he’d be great, but I just didn’t have as much time as I thought I had to even consider it more and line up work and spend time with him, etc.

> 过了一个月左右，我写信给他并告诉他我真的很抱歉。我误导（耽误）了他——也耽误了我自己——认为我有足够的时间在那个夏天带一下实习生。我想这样，我真的喜欢他，我认为他很不错，但我只是没有我想我有的那么多的时间， 甚至是多考虑一下这件事（的时间），安排工作（的时间），花时间和他一起，等等。

But really, as I thought about it, I realized I had the time. Every day is the same 24 hour cycle. Every workday around 8 hours. Surely I could have found even 20 minutes a day to work with him. But it wasn’t that. It wasn’t that I couldn’t find the time. I couldn’t find the *attention* — especially *sustained* attention.

但是真的，当我想到这件事时，我意识到我是有时间的。每天都是相同的24小时循环。每个工作日大约是8小时。我当然可以每天找出20分钟的时间来和他一起工作。但并不是这样。不是我找不到时间，我是找不到注意力——特别是*持续的*注意力。      

My mind fills up with a few key projects and that’s it. I’m absorbed by those. That’s where my attention is. <u>Had I made 20 minutes here and there for him, I’d be physically present in that moment, but mentally I’d be elsewhere.</u> And that’s not fair to either of us.

> 我的脑海里充满了几个关键的项目，就是这样。我被他们所吸引了。这就是我注意力所在的地方  。如果我零零散散地为他腾出20分钟的时间，那时候我外在上是在那里的，但我精神上会在其他地方，这对我们两个中的任何一个都不公平。 

Time and attention aren’t the same thing. They're barely related.

> 时间和注意力并不是一个东西，他们几乎没有关联
