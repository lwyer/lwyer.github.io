# You're not uncool. Making friends as an adult is just hard(不是你的问题，成年后交朋友太难了) | 翻译


When you were a kid, it seemed like you could walk up to just about anybody and be best friends the next minute. <u>But somewhere along the long, winding road to adulthood</u>, making new friends became an impossibly hard thing to do. 

> 当你还是一个孩子时，似乎你可以走到任何人身边，并在下一分钟成为最好的朋友。但在通往成年之路的漫长曲折的某个地方，交新朋友变成了一件不可能的事情。

Well according to psychologist and University of Maryland professor [Marisa G. Franco](https://drmarisagfranco.com/), that’s because as you get older, making friends no longer happens organically.

>好吧，根据Maryland大学的教授，心理学家[Marisa G. Franco](https://drmarisagfranco.com/)所说，这是因为当你长大后，交朋友不再自然而然地发生。

“Sociologists have kind of identified the ingredients that need to be in place for us to make friends organically, and they are continuous unplanned interaction and shared vulnerability,” says Franco, who is writing a book on making friends as an adult. “But as we become adults, we have less and less environments where those ingredients are at play.”

> ”社会学家已经确定了一些我们自然而然交朋友所需的因素，他们是持续地没有目的地互动和共同的弱点（脆弱性）“，正在写一本关于成人交朋友的书的Franco说，“但是当我们长大成人，我们越来越缺少让这些因素发挥作用的环境。“

If we continue to expect friendships to happen naturally like they did when we were kids, <u>we run the risk of waiting for something that might never come</u>. Being intentional is essential, she says. Research shows those who view friendships as something that happens because of luck are lonelier later on in life, she says, “and those who see it as something that happens based on effort are less lonely years later.”

> 如果我们继续期望友谊像我们小时候那样自然发生，我们就会冒一种等待可能永远不会发生的事情的风险。（在交朋友这件事上）刻意一点是有必要的。她还说，研究表明，那些认为友谊是一种因为运气而发生的人，（在有这种想法）之后会感觉更加孤独，而那些认为友谊是一种依靠努力发生的人之后会比较不觉得孤独一些。

Juliana Clark, a 25-year-old audio producer living in Los Angeles, says that <u>while</u> she’s been able to make a few friends here and there, she is mostly looking for a community. Spending a few minutes with a new acquaintance doesn’t usually leave her with a feeling that a new friendship is blossoming.

> Juliana Clark是一个25岁的住在洛杉矶的音频制作人，她说虽然她能够或多或少交到一些朋友，但她主要是在寻找一个团体（共同体）。与刚认识的人相处几分钟通常不会让他感觉友谊正在开花结果。

“I'm really more interested in kind of creating a sustainable community that will last,” she says, “especially <u>since</u> at least so many of the friendships that I've made just in my life have kind of had these common experiences anchoring them.”

> "我真正更加感兴趣的是创建一种可持续的，互相支撑的团体（社区）"，她说，“特别是因为至少我一生中结交的友谊都有些这样的共同的经历来巩固他们（指友谊）。”

According to Franco, the key to building a community of friends is setting up planned interactions, like regular group events or <u>rotating</u> potlucks.

> 根据Franco所说，建立朋友圈的关键是举行一些有计划的活动（互动），比如定期的团体活动或者轮流聚餐。

“Researchers also find that when we develop groups, our friendships are more sustainable than they are with individuals. Because there's multiple touch points now, right? Someone else in the group could reach out to all of us, and then we all keep in touch,” she notes.

> “研究人员还发现当我们发展集体活动，我们的友谊比那些以个人形式发展的友谊更可持续。因为现在有多种接触点（接触方式），对吗？在团体里的其他人可以联系到我们所有人，之后我们所有人都保持联系。“她说。

If that sounds terrifying to you, Franco says it’s crucial to assume that people already like you. Assume any meet ups will go well, she says, which in turn will help build up your confidence.

“We all have this tendency to think we're more likely to be rejected than we actually are,” she says.

> 如果这听起来让你感觉害怕，Franco说假设其他人已经喜欢你是至关重要的。她说，假设所有的聚会都进行得很顺利，这样会反过来帮助你建立信心。
>
> 她说：”我们都有这样一个倾向，认为我们比我们实际上更可能被拒绝（认为我们可能会被拒绝，而实际上不是这样）。“

**How age, gender play a role in forming friendships**

As we move through life, our struggles change. People in their 30s and their 40s have voiced how having kids or moving to a new city made it tough for them to form connections.

> 随着我们在生活中前进，我们所奋斗的事情也会发生变化。30几岁的人和40几岁的人表示，有了孩子或者搬到一个新的城市如何使得他们产生联系变得困难。

Kate Hickcox, 42, moved to Maine from New York City with her husband in 2018. The mom of two young children says she and her husband still haven't met any new friends in their more rural life. The pandemic worsened the situation since making plans was off the table.

> Kate Hickcox，42岁，和她的丈夫在2018年从纽约搬到Maine。这位两个年轻孩子的妈妈说在她们这段更乡村的生活中，她和她的丈夫仍然没有遇到其他的新朋友。疫情加重了这个情况，因为他们无法制定计划。

“I'm also a city girl. I often feel like an outsider when trying to engage with those in my new local Maine community who either grew up here and have established connections or those who moved here because of their love of nature and the outdoors,” she says. “I thought I could <u>force</u> friendship to happen by attending events or participating in local sports or activities.”

> “我仍然是个城市女孩，当我尝试努力和Maine本地社区的人来往时，我经常感觉像是一个外来者（局外人）。他们要么是在这里长大的并且已经建立了一些关系，要么是因为热爱自然和户外来到这里。”她说，”我认为我可以通过参加活动或者参加当地的运动和事件来促进友谊的发生。“

Franco says people like Hickcox shouldn’t be too hard on themselves because making friends is tough no matter who you are<u>. She recommends working to overcome covert avoidance — when you show up to an event but are mentally checked out.</u>

> Franco说像Hickcox这样的人们不应对自己太过苛刻，因为无论是谁，交朋友都是一件困难的事情。她建议努力克服隐蔽性回避——当你出现在一个活动中，而在精神上却不在。

“You're on your phone, you're waiting for people to come to you, you're not introducing yourself to people,” she says. “It's not just that you have to attend that event, but you have to overcome covert avoidance by engaging with people when you get there.”

> ”你在玩你的手机，你在等待别人来找你，你没有将你自己介绍给大家。“她说，”这不仅仅是你要参加活动，而且你要在活动中通过和大家互动来克服这种隐蔽性回避。“

It’s essential to take the extra step and ask for contact information.

“That's really, really key to take it from, ‘Hey, I'm putting myself out there’ to ‘We're actually going to form a connection and begin to form a friendship,’ ” Franco adds.

> 采取额外的步骤并询问联系信息是必要的。
>
> ”这真的非常，非常关键，从’嘿，把我自己放在这里‘到’我们确实要开始建立联系并且开始建立友谊。“Franco补充道。

There's also a number of people who find themselves more and more isolated as they get older. David Troxel never got married and never had children. The 64 year old says that he's been socially disconnected for the last 10 years or more.

> 也有很多人发现自己随着年龄增长，变得更加孤独了。David Troxel 从未结婚，并且没有孩子。这个64岁的老人说他在过去10年已经社会性失联了，甚至不止10年。

“I find that typically, people have all or most of the social connections that they can manage,” Troxel says. “I met somebody several years ago that I thought I might get to be friends with and invited them out to have coffee with me. I was told that this person really had all the friends that they need.”

> ”我发现通常来说，人们可以经营他们全部或者大部分的社会关系。“Troxel说，”几年前，我遇到一些我认为可能能成为朋友的人，我邀请他们一起喝咖啡。我被告知说，这个人已经有了他说需要的所有朋友。“

Franco says men often have more trouble making friends than women because of the way society perceives them. Men are also more likely to rely on their romantic partners for a social network.

> Franco说，因为社会对男性的看法，男人在交朋友上通常比女人更困难。男人更可能依赖他们的恋人来经营社交网络。

“There's this phenomenon called homohysteria, which is the fear of being perceived as gay that I think really, really is destructive for men's friendships,” she says.

Eventually, loneliness can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

> ”有一种现象叫做同性歇斯底里症，这是一种害怕被视为同性恋的恐惧，我认为这种现象对男性之间的友谊非常，非常具有破坏性。“她说。
>
> 最终，孤独会变成一种自我实现的预言。

“If you are in a place of loneliness, you are, according to the research, more likely to assume people are going to reject you,” Franco explains. “You're just <u>sort of</u> hyper vigilant for rejection and social threats. You're more likely to think that social interactions will be more negative and less enjoyable.”

> ”如果你正在处于孤独的状态中，那么根据研究，你更可能假设其他人会拒绝你。“Franco解释说，”你只是某种程度上对拒绝和社会危机高度警惕。你只是更可能去认为社会联系会使你更消极，更不愉快。“

That’s why she says it’s of the utmost importance for people like Troxel to keep putting themselves out there.

“You had this one negative experience. It had sucked. Someone said they had too many friends, right?,” she says. “But that certainly doesn't mean that everybody has too many friends, and that certainly doesn't mean that there aren't people out there that are just waiting for you to connect with them,” she says.

The world is likely more open to you than you think it is, Franco adds, and there’s a chance more people out there want to be your friend.

> 这就是为什么她说，对于像Troxel这样的人来说，让自己坚持下去是最重要的。
>
> ”你有过一次这种消极的经理。它糟透了。有人说他们的朋友太多，对吗？“她说，”但这真的不意味着所有人都有太多的朋友，并且不意味着没有人在等你联系他们。“
>
> 世界对你来说可能比你想象的更开放，Franco补充道，而且总会有这样的可能，很多人在等你，并且想成为你的朋友。
