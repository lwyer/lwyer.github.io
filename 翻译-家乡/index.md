# Town(家乡) | 翻译


I recently shifted from my home town to Delhi – the country's capital. When I was in my town, I missed Delhi. When I am in Delhi now, I miss my home town.

> 最近我离开家乡来到德里--国家的首都。当我在我的家乡时，我想去德里，可当我真正在德里时，我想念我的家乡。

You ask why?

Why I wanted to move to Delhi is a story for another day. But I will tell you why I desire to move back to my small and still home town.

> 你问我为什么？
>
> 我为什么想去德里改天再说吧，但是我想告诉你的是我为什么想从德里回到我那小小的平静的家乡。

Cities and towns have souls of their own. You don’t just live in them; you live with them. If you like their company, things will align themselves to make you successful and happy. But if you don’t like the company, you will keep bumping into the wrong things.

Once I liked Delhi’s company. But I am not enjoying it anymore because

- The bigger the city, the faster its manners of living.
- When you physically live around people who are in your profession, you constantly feel more competition.
- Big towns have big people. The bigger the people, the more their gravitational force. My Delhi friends are doing their own big things. And I get sucked into those things willingly or non-willingly.

> 大城市和小城镇有着他们自己的灵魂。你不是住在他们那里，而是和他们生活在一起。如果你喜欢他们的陪伴，你想做的事情就会和你步调一致，从而使你事业有成，生活愉快。但是如果你不喜欢他们的陪伴，你会不断地遇上那些错误的事情。
>
> 我曾喜欢过德里的陪伴，但我现在已经不喜欢了，因为
>
> - 城市越大，它的生活方式越快。
> - 当你的周围都是和你一样的同行，你会不断地感受到更多的竞争。
> - 大城市里有大人物。这个人越“大”，他就有更多的“地心引力”。我在德里的朋友们总是在做他们自己的“大”事，可我总是自愿或不自愿地被牵扯进这些事情中。

I agreed with Naval Ravikant when he said, “Choosing what city to live in can almost completely determine the trajectory of your life, but we spend so little time trying to figure out what city to live in.”

Many people think of moving to a big, more vibrant city when they read Naval's quote. But I think of moving to a small town. A town that is closer to nature. A town where I can get closer to myself than to other people.

> 我同意Naval Ravikan（一个企业家）说的，“选择在什么样的城市生活几乎可以完全决定你的生活轨迹，但我们总是不假思索地就决定了我们想要居住的城市。”
>
> 当读到Naval的这句话时，很多人想到的是去一个大的，更生机勃勃的城市。但是我想到的是去一个小城镇，一个更接近自然的城镇，一个我可以更接近自我而不是他人的城镇。
